# Art-Gallery

This project was developed by two undergraduate students as part of our web development course for the semester.

The goal of this project was to create a fully functional website to learn and practice essential front-end and back-end development skills. The technologies we used include html, css, javascript and handlebars.

The website can be found on https://artgallery34.herokuapp.com/ (for a limited time period).
