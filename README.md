# Art-Gallery

This project was developed by two undergraduate students as part of our web development course for the semester.

The goal of this project was to create a fully functional website to learn and practice essential front-end and back-end development skills. 
->We used notable front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap and JQuery combined with some native css/html styling for fully functional mobile interaction. 
->Handlebars library was selected for advanced efficiency regarding the project's templating. 
->Concerning the back-end, we opted for the ExpressJS framework whilst catering to ES6 standardization. A single MongoDB cluster was used to support the entire collection of images used for the project without resorting to external cloud solutions, minimizing dependencies. 
->Fully operational and up-to-date(as of quarter 2, 2023) password encryption and basic database operations(e.g. updating/adding/deleting entries) supported for convenient administration of content.


The website can be found on https://artgallery34.herokuapp.com/ (for a limited time period).
